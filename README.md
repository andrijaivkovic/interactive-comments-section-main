## Overview

### The challenge

**Users should be able to:**

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus / IMPLEMENTED**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus / IMPLEMENTED**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

**Additions:**

- A dropdown to change the active user
- A reset button to reset the app state

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) - for creating unique keys of React list items

### What I learned

By building this challenge is learned more about how React works, especially the useRef hook that I used to reference DOM nodes in this app.

### Continued development

In the future I'd like to get more comfortable using React to build apps, but this challenge was a good way to practice what I already know and push myself further.
